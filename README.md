## Technical Description

This project was built from the ground up to be a lightweight and engaging portfolio. The core of the application is a single HTML file (`index.html`) that contains the structure for all UI elements, including the desktop, icons, and window templates.

### Key Features:

* **Window Management:** The UI is fully interactive, with draggable and resizable windows managed through vanilla JavaScript. A z-index system ensures that the most recently clicked window always appears on top.
* **Functional Terminal:** The terminal emulator accepts a set of predefined commands (`about`, `projects`, `contact`, `clear`) and provides interactive responses, including a "copy to clipboard" feature for contact information.
* **Interactive Music Player:** The vinyl player uses the HTML5 Audio API to play a playlist of songs, with controls for play/pause, next/previous tracks, and volume adjustment.
* **Dynamic Background:** The `particles.js` library is used to generate an animated, interactive background, adding a layer of visual depth to the OS experience.

### Technologies Used:

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** All logic for window management, the terminal, the music player, and other interactive elements is written in vanilla JavaScript.
* **HTML5:** The structure of the application is built with semantic HTML.
* **Tailwind CSS:** All styling is handled through Tailwind CSS, with a few custom CSS classes for unique elements like the pixel-art taskbar and custom scrollbars.
* **particles.js:** Used for the animated background.
